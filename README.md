# Webpage for Analyzing and Vizualising a PowerBI Datamodel
#### Video Demo:  <URL HERE>
#### Description:

For my final project in CS50's Introduction to Computer Science, I am excited to present a web application I developed, designed to transform how users interact with PowerBI data models. This application features two main components: the Auto-Formatter and the Visualizer, each crafted to offer powerful and user-friendly functionalities.

1. Auto-Formatter:
In this module, I focused on simplifying data management. The Auto-Formatter allows users to modify all measures and definitions in a PowerBI data model simultaneously, rather than the standard, time-consuming method of adjusting each one individually. This feature streamlines the formatting process, significantly improving efficiency and accuracy in data handling.

2. Visualizer:
The Visualizer, the second key component of my project, brings data models to life through several innovative features:

3D Force Graph Visualization: I implemented a 3D force graph to provide a dynamic and interactive representation of the data model, offering users a novel way to engage with complex data structures.
Interactive Node Analysis: By clicking on a node within the graph, users can explore the potential impacts of changes to various elements of the data model, such as related measures, tables, and columns. This interactive element offers deep insights into how different parts of the data model are interconnected.
Data Model Overview: The tool also presents essential information about the data model, providing a comprehensive understanding of its structure.
Technological Integration: For the visualizations, I utilized 3D.js packages and want to give a special shoutout to Vasturion's npm package, which significantly contributed to the development process.
Technical Details:
I developed the application using Vite+React, embracing modern web development practices. The project is hosted on GitHub Pages and automatically updated through GitHub Actions, ensuring that it always reflects the latest advancements and features.
